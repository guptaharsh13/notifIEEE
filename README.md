## Problem Statement
Often people forget to acknowledge meeting or task messages on slack and the fact that their is a message on slack has to communicated to every single person via other means! So we made a Slack Bot to tackle this
## Inspiration
We have been in this situdation as well where we get low attendance in meetings as a lot of our peers often miss slack notifications and we have to communicate through whatsapp the exact same thing we post on slack!
## What it does
We built an awesome SlackBot that adds events to your google calendar and sends push notification about those meetings
## How we built it
We teamed up first . Divided work of making the slackbot and using google api we schedule a meet to your calendar so you never miss another beat of your meet.
## How to Use it
Just Invite the bot and using the following commands</br>
"/plan tomorrow's meet, 10-01-2022/10:30 duration:1"
